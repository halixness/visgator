    "Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is the task of localizing a target object in an image given a natural language expression that refers to it. Most recent approaches ([Zhang et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05836), [Xu et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00402), [Liu et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499)) that obtain state-of-the-art results on this task are not specifically designed for it, but they are designed to solve a large variety of tasks that require fusing vision and language modalities, like open-set object detection, image captioning, visual question answering and so on. In particular, most of these first independently encode the the visual and textual input using vision and text encoders (based on the Transformer architecture) respectively, then another transformer module is used to fuse the two modalities by making the visual features attend to the textual features and vice versa. Finally, the fused features are given in input to another module (a simple head, a transformer decoder, etc.) based on the task that is being solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we argue that the task of REC requires an high-level understanding of the scene described the region caption. For example, given a caption like *\"The girl approaching the table while holding a glass\"*, to correctly localize the associated bounding box, we need to first identify all the entities referred by the sentence (`the girl`, `the table`, `a glass`) and the relation that exist among them ((`the girl` -- `approaching` -> `the table`), (`the girl` -- `holding` --> `a glass`)). In other words, we need to extract from the sequence of words that form the sentence an intermediate higher-level representation of the scene. Then, instead of grounding the sequence of words to the image, we can ground the intermediate representation to the image. On the other hand, previously cited approaches, since they need to generalize to many image-text tasks, simply ground the word features (here we make the simplifying assumption that each token correspond to a word) extracted by the text encoder to the image features. Thus, to perform well in such task, the text encoder need to encode into each token not only the meaning of the corresponding word but also its relations with the other entities that in the sentence may be refered by group of tokens. In toher words, the text encoder need to learn to extract from the sequence of tokens a higher-level representation without being explicitly supervised to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this observation, we propose a new approach to REC that is specifically designed for this task by making the network directly exploit the higher-level semantic information encoded in the input sentence. In particular, from the input sentence we extract a scene graph representing which entities are present in the region and how they are related to each other. Then, we localize the target region by localizing in the image the referred entities that satisfy the referred relations."

    "### High level architecture overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our architecture is highly inspired to DETR-like models ([Carion et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872), [Gao et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07448), [Liu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12329)). Such models use a (CNN) backbone followed by a transformer-based vision encoder to extract visual features from the input image. Then a set of queries (representing candidate bounding boxes) is given in input to a transformer-based decoder, where such queries go through layers of self-attention and cross-attention with the visual features. Finally, the output of the decoder is given in input to a simple head that predicts the bounding boxes coordinates and the class of each bounding box. At training time, Hungarian matching is used to obtain a one-to-one matching between a query and a ground truth bounding box. Once such association is obtained, the loss is computed by comparing the predicted bounding box with the associated ground truth bounding box. At inference time, the predicted bounding boxes are filtered by a simple post-processing step to remove the predicted bounding boxes that have a low confidence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we extract the visual features by employing a transformer-based vision encoder (no backbone is used since we use the CLIP vision encoder). Then, differently from DETR-like models, we do not generate a predefined set of fixed or learnable queries, but we create a graph based on the one extracted from the sentence. In particular, for each entity in the sentence scene graph we create multiple nodes in the graph (since in the image there may be multiple instances of the same entity) whose embeddings are initialized with the embedding obtained by giving in input to the CLIP text encoder the entity textual description extracted from the sentence. Then, we create an edge between two nodes if the corresponding entities are related in the sentence scene graph; as before, the edge features are initialized by encoding the textual description of the relation with the CLIP text encoder. Then, the generated graph is given in input to the transformer-based decoder whose blocks consist of a sequence of `Multi-Head Cross Attention`, `Graph Attention` and `FFN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multi-head cross attention layer, each query (nodes + edges) can attend to the visual features extracted from the vision encoder. This allow each query to verify whether the associated entity/relation is present in a specific region of the image. Then, in the graph attention layer, each node can communicate with its neighbours and the associated relations to verify whether the encoded instance of the entity satisfy the relations encoded in the sentence scene graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, from the graph outputted by the decoder, we extract the nodes that represent the subject of the sentence (i.e. the target entity) and we give them in input to a simple head to obtain candidate bounding boxes for the target entity. At training time, a simple matching algorithm is applied to associate the ground truth bounding box with one of the predicted bounding boxes and the loss is computed. At inference time, we select the node (and the obtained bounding box) whose embedding is the most similar to the embedding obtained by giving in input to the CLIP text encoder the full sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As currently presented, the decoder should also perform open-set object detection, since for each entity it should localize all the instances in the image. Thus, we should create a sufficient high number of nodes for each entity to be able to localize all the instances of the entity in the image. For example, Grounding DINO ([Liu et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499)) creates 900 queries for each image. This would clearly require a lot of memory and computation power. Furthermore, current open-set object detectors are trained on huge amounts of data, on many GPUs and for long period of times (Grounding DINO uses 64 A100). Given the limited resources availables, we decided to employ an open-set object detector to obtain all instances of an entity in the image and an estimate of their location. In this way the decoder does not need to perform open-set object detection from scratch but it only needs to refine the estimated locations. Since existing open-set object detectors are mainly trained on closed object detection datasets, where each entity to be detected is represented by a single noun (i.e., the category name), to make the detector localize an entity we do not use its full textual description. Instead, for each entity we extract a single noun that best describe that entity. For example, given the entity `The woman with dark hair`, we extract the noun `woman` to localize the entity."

    "### How to extract scene graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously said, one of the first step is the extraction of the region scene graph from its text description. This task can be seen as the union of two closely related problems: named entity recognition and relation extraction. Since these tasks have long been studied by the NLP community, we have tried many existing solutions or we took inspiration from them to build our own. In the following we will describe the main approaches we have tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into details, we notice that the generation of a scene graph from a sentence is an ambiguous task, that is the same sentence could be parsed into different scene graphs. When two noun phrases are connected by an action verb, it seems obvious to identify each noun as an entity and the verb as a relation. However, when the nouns are connected by a preposition, the situation is more ambiguous. For example, in the sentence *\"the woman in a green shirt\"*, the noun phrase `a green shirt` could be considered an attribute of `the woman` or a different entity related to `the woman` with the relation `in`/`wearing`. Similarly, in the sentence *\"the woman on the right\"*, some people may consider `the right` as an actual physical location and thus as an entity, while others may consider it as an attribute of `the woman`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most phrases in the RefCOCOg dataset are quite short, if we preferred the attribute interpretation, we would have obtained many scene graphs with very few nodes and edges or no edges at all, thus jeopardizing the idea underlying the model. For this reason, we have generally preferred the creation of a new entity for each noun phrase. However, we have preferred the attribute interpretation, when we thought that the detector would find it difficult to localize such entity (for example, in the case of spatial locations like `the right`, `the left`, `the background`, etc.)."

    "#### Dependency Graph based parsers\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, one of the first approach to parse sentences in natural language into scene graphs was the one proposed by ([Schuster et al. 2015](https://aclanthology.org/W15-2812.pdf)). First the sentence is parsed into a semantic graph (i.e., a dependency graph to which some refinements are applied, like the handling of pronouns and plural nouns) using the CoreNLP pipeline. Then, based on a set of human-written rules, the semantic graph is converted into a scene graph. This approach has been used in many past works for different purposes, like evaluating generated image captions ([Anderson et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08822)) or creating pseudo ground truth scene graphs for Weakly Supervised Scene Graph Generation ([Ye et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13994), [Zhong et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02227), [Li et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01834)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, since the original parser is written in Java, we used a Python-based [tool](https://github.com/vacancy/SceneGraphParser) that covers all the rules implemented in the Stanford Parser with some additional ones (however, it does not implement some features like pronoun handling and quantificational modifiers).\n"

In particular, due to the low quality of many sentences in the dataset (e.g., typos, not perfect syntactic structure), the dependency graph generated by the spaCy `en_core_web_sm` pipeline in many cases assign the wrong universal dependency relation tag between two words, thus leading to the wrong conversion into a scene graph.\n",

Then, based on the dependency graphs generated for some sentences of the dataset and the corresponding ground-truth scene graphs, we developed a new set of rules."

    "Despite the promising results obtained on some sentences, we abandoned this approach for two reasons:\n",
    "1. The quality of the resulting scene graph depends too much on the quality of the dependency graph generated by the parser. In particular, even though the new parser correclty parses more complex sentences, it still fails at handling long-range connections between words or relations that can be inferred from common sense. For example, in the sentence *\"There is a truck covered in snow farthest from the right\"*, the parser connects the clause `farthest from the right` to the clause `covered in snow`. While this interpretation of the sentence may be deemed right (the sentence is ambiguous), the preferred interpretation should be that `farthest from the right` is an attribute of the entity `the truck`. However, the parser is not able to infer this relation, thus leading to the wrong scene graph. "

    "2. Defining a set of universal rules to handle all possible structures of English sentences (even malformed ones) is extremely hard. In particular, there are many sentences that have very similar dependency graphs that, however, should be transformed in different scene graphs, thus requiring not only to handle the structure of the sentence, but also its semantics. For example, the expressions *\"the part of the table\"*, *\"the first horse from the left\"* and *\"the woman in green clothes\"*, have very similar dependency graphs, but in the first two cases the expressions should be considered a single entity, while in the last case they should be considered two different entities related by the relation `wearing`."

    "#### Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models pretrained on large text corpora have recently shown to be able to reach state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks for which they were not explicitly trained, like question answering, summarization and text generation. Furthermore, since these models seem to show emergent reasoning capabilities ([Liu et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03439)), we considered their use for this task that, as previously said, requires common sense and the ability to understand the scene context described by the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first attempts, we tried to use open LLM available on the HuggingFace site, like [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct), [Alpaca-13B](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html), Stable-Vicuna-13B, given the possibility to use their quantized version and thus running them on single gpus with only 8/16 GB of memory. For all our experiments we adopted a few-shot approach, i.e., in the prompt we described the task and then we provided a set of examples of the task. When generating the prompt, the main tradeoff was between the number of examples (and thus the inference time) and the quality of the generated scene graphs. At the end, we decided to use 5 examples that allowed us to show the model a variety of sentences with different structures and relations."

    "Some considerations on the quality of the generated scene graphs:\n",
    "1. Among the methods previously illustrated, the graph generated with ChatGPT are by far the best ones, but they are still far from perfect. In particular, we noticed that ChatGPT is inconsistent in the generated scene graphs, i.e., clauses with extremely similar structures (and thus corresponding scene graphs) are associated to different scene graphs. For example, spatial locations are not always treated as attributes of the entity they refer to, but they are sometimes parsed as spatial relations, despite the mutliple example in the prompt. Furthermore, we noticed that sometimes the text associated to a relation is also associated to one of the entities involved.\n",
    "2. The textual descriptions of the parsed entities and relations are strongly based on the words present in the input sentence. For example, in a sentence like *\"the woman in a green shirt\"*, the relation is described simply using the preposition `in` like it is in the sentence. While this is not wrong, a better description of the relation would be `wearing`. Similarly, in the sentence *\"the zebra walking with its young one*\", the detected entities are `the zebra` and `its young one` which is not wrong, but a better description would be `the zebra` and `the young zebra`. When generating the prompt, we tried to teach the model to not necessarily use the words present in the sentence, but the model started to hallucinate thus compromising the quality of the generated scene graphs. <br>\n",
    "We noticed similar results when we tried to make the model generate different relations based on whether the subject of the relation in the scene graph is also the subject of the relation in the sentence. For example, given a sentence like *\"the girl looking at the table\"*, the generated scene graph would be a graph with two nodes (`the girl`, `the table`) and an undirected edge between the two representing the relation `looking at`. We tried to make the model create a directed scene graph with the relation `looking at` from `the girl` to `the table` and the relation `being looked at` from `the table` to `the girl`, but the model started to hallucinate. <br>\n",
    "Notice that GPT4 is instead able to generate such more complex scene graphs, showing that it has a better \"understading\" of the content of the sentence. Unfortunately, the GPT4 API were not openly available at the time of the project and their cost is 20x higher than the cost of the ChatGPT API."

If by doing so, the longest size is longer than 1333px, then we resize the image such that its longest size is 1333px (still keeping the aspect ratio). This is the same strategy used by Grounding DINO. The we standardize the image using the channels mean and standard deviation used by CLIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessor is also the step where the scene graph is generated. Since generating the scene graph using ChatGPT has a high latency (more than 10 seconds), it is not feasible to perform this step in real time. Thus, we preprocessed the whole dataset before training the model. The generated scene graphs are then stored in a json file that is loaded by the preprocessor at initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the candidate bounding boxes are generated from the embeddings of the subject nodes, in case the generated scene graph has more than one connected component, we remove from the scene graph all components except the one containing the subject entity. In fact, since during the `Graph Attention` step, each node can pass directly (or indirectly thorugh its neighbours) messages only with the nodes in the same connected component, nodes in different connected components would not be able to exchange messages and thus influence the embeddings of the subject nodes. Keeping them would thus be useless."

    "##### Vision Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The vision encoder used is a modified version of the ViT encoder used by CLIP. In particular, the original CLIP vision encoder returns a simgle embedding for each image. In our case, we need it to return a feature map for each image to allow each query to attend to different parts of the image. Thus, we modified the cLIP implementation by removing the attention-based pooling and taking the patch embeddings of the last layer as the feature map. Similarly to OwlViT ([Minderer et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230)), we further multiply each patch embedding with the class token and we apply a layer norm. The authors of OwlViT state that this last operation improves the performance of the model, but no explanation if given. Probably, this allow each patch to encode information of the whole image and not only of a specific region. Since the feature dimension of each patch is 768, we also apply a final linear projection to reduce the dimension to 256 (the same dimension used by DETR-like models). To avoid losing all the information of the discarded linear projection, we initialize the weights by applying PCA to the original weights (even though no significant improvement was observed with respect to random initialization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that the original CLIP encoder resizes and center-crops each image to a 224x224 format. By resizing the image to such a small dimension, small details in the image may be lost, that may be important for the object detection task. Firthermore, by center cropping the image, some parts of the image thatmay contain some of the entities referred in the sentence may be cropped out. Thus, as previously said, we resize each image to a larger size and we do not apply cropping. This is similar to what is done by OwlViT. However, while OwlViT resizes each image to a fixed size, we keep the original aspect ratio and we use padding (with attention masking) to handle images of different sizes in the same batch. Similarly to OwlViT, we do not discard the learned positional embeddings of CLIP, but we simply interpolate them to the new image size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We used the CLIP vision encoder based on ViT instead of ResNet-50 because we verified that when giving in input to the encoder images with a larger size than what the model was trained on, the final embeddings were more similar to the embeddings obtained by using the 224x224 image. Thus it seems that the ViT encoder is more robust to changes in the input size."

    "##### OwlViT\n",
    "\n",
    "As open-set object detector we decided to use OwlVit ([Minderer et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230)) given its not poor performances (both in terms of inference speed and localization capabilities) and simplicity. Indeed, OwlViT is based on a pair of vision and text encoders that are pretrained on a contrastive image-text task, exactly like CLIP. Then, such architecture is finetuned on object detection by adding a simple regression head on top of the vision encoder. In particular, each patch (outputted by the vision encoder) is given in input to the regression head to predict the bounding boxes offsets with repsect to the patch position. The similarity between each patch and the text embeddings of the entities to detect is computed to obtain the confidence score that the patch contains the entity. A threshold is then applied to the confidence scores to obtain the final set of bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the implementation, we used the one provided by [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/owlvit) with a modification to handle the case in which a given entity is not detected. In particular, if no instance of an entity is detected with a confidence score higher than the threshold, we select the __k__ most confident bounding boxes for that entity even if their confidence score is lower than the threshold. Even if the estimated locations of an entity are not accurate, we consider this approach better than not detecting the entity at all. Indeed, if the input scene graph is (`the girl` -- `approaching` --> `the table`), if no table is detected, the new graph will consist only of nodes associated to the entity `the girl`, thus missing the information that `the girl` that needs to be found is the one that is approaching `the table`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than OwlViT we also tried to use Grounding DINO as object detector. However, despite the better performance with respect to OwlViT, the inference speed was too slow making the training time for a single epoch more than double."

    "In DETR-like models, the decoder contains a self-attention step to make each query proposal attend to all the other query proposals allowing them to exchange information. Such information can be used for example to avoid two queries to be assigned to the same entity or to suggest that an entity may be present (for example, if a query is associated to a ball, then there may be a kid in the adjacent region). In our case, however an entity node does not need to attend to all the other entities but only to the ones with which it should have a relation according to the scene graph. However, we also add edges (whose features are initialized with learnable parameters) between all nodes associated to the same entity to avoid multiple nodes to focus on the same entity instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exchaning information with its neighbours, each node can determine whether the associated entity instance is the one referred in the sentence. For example, if the sentence were *\"the girl approaching the table\"*, the generated scene graph would be (`the girl` -- `approaching` -> `the table`). If two different instances of a girl are found in the image, we need to choose which instance is the right one. Suppose also that only one instance of table is detected. When passing messages with the `table` node, each `girl` node can determine whether it is the right one by checking whether the relation `approaching` exists between the two nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, to update the graph features, we do not use the self-attention mechanism (that can be considered a [graph operation](https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/)), but we use a more traditional message passing graph neural network (MPNN). In particular, we decided to use Graph Attention ([Veličković et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903), [Brody at el. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491)), given its simplicity and the good results obtained in many tasks (there are more performant graph operations but since we operate on very small graphs the advantages should not be significant).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second version of Graph Attention ([Brody at el. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491)), the node features are updated as follows:\n",
    "1. the messages passed by the node's neighbours (usually, the one hop neighourhood) are collected;\n",
    "2. the messages are aggregated, each weighted by an attention coefficient that measures the relevance of the message for the node (to compute the relance, edge features can also be used if present);\n",
    "3. the current node features are combined with the aggregated messages to obtain the new node features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In formulas:\n",
    "$$ x_i' = \\alpha_{ii} \\theta x_i + \\sum_{j \\in N_i}{\\alpha_{ij} \\theta x_j} $$ \n",
    "and the attention coefficients are computed as:\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp{(W_2^\\top \\textrm{LeakyReLU}(W_1 [x_i || x_j || e_{ij}]))}}{\\sum_{k \\in N_i \\cup \\{i\\}}{\\exp{(W_2^\\top \\textrm{LeakyReLU}(W_1 [x_i || x_k || e_{ik}]))}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$, $W_1$ and $W_2$ are learnable parameters, $e_{ij}$ is the edge feature between node $i$ and $j$ and $||$ is the concatenation operator. Usually, multi-head attention is used, where different attention coefficients are computed for each head, thus obtaining different node features for each head. The final node features are obtained by concatenating the node features of each head.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to such formulation, we make two main modifications:\n",
    "1. we do not use $\\textrm{LeakyReLU}$ but we use $\\textrm{GELU}$ in the attention coefficients computation;\n",
    "2. we add a step to also update the edge features. In particular, we compute the edge features as:\n",
    "$$ e_{ij}' = W_3 \\textrm{GELU}(W_1 [x_i || x_j || e_{ij}]) $$ \n",
    "that is we concatenate the endpoint nodes features and the edge features and we apply a MLP with one hidden layer to obtain the new edge features."

    "The cross-attention operation in the decoder is not different from the one used in DETR-like models, that is the nodes and edges of the graph returned by the last decoder layer are used as queries, while the visual features outputted by the encoder are used to compute the keys and values. This allows each node to detect whether in the associated region there is the corresponding entity and allows each edge to detect whether the relation is present between the two endpoint nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent works ([Gao et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07448), [Men et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06152), [Liu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12329)) have argued that one the reasons why DETR requires extremely long training time is that, since in cross-attention each box query attend to all the patches in the image, the network needs to learn how to make each box focus only on a small area of the image by giving high importance only to the patches associated to that area. To make it easier for the network to do this, such works propose different techniques. For example, [Men et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06152) propose to concatenate to each patch its positional encoding and to do the same for each query box. Thus, boxes and patches with close spatial positions will have similar positional encodings. In this way, when computing the dot product between them, the similarity will be higher and higher importance will be given to that patch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, we adopt the technique proposed by [Gao et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07448). In particular, given a node with associated boundign box coordinates $(c_x, c_y, w, h)$, we compute a Gaussian-like weight map as\n",
    "$$ G(i, j) = \\exp{(- \\frac{(i - c_x)^2}{\\beta w^2} - \\frac{(j - c_y)^2}{\\beta h^2} )} $$\n",
    "where $(i, j) \\in [0, W] \\times [0, H] $ is the position of a patch in the feature map; $\\beta$ is an hyperparameter (here, set to 1) to modulate the width of the Gaussian-like function. When computing the cross-attention matrix between a node and the patches, we sum this weight map to the dot product between the node and the patches. In this way, the network is encouraged to give more importance to the patches close to the center of the node bounding box. For the edges, we compute the Gaussian-like weight map by choosing for each position $(i, j)$ the maximum value between the weight maps of the edge endpoints and the weight map computed using the smallest bounding box containing the two bounding boxes of the endpoints. Thus, similarly to previous works ([Wang et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14023)), we assume that the key information to detect a relation is always in the middle of the two bounding boxes, even if it has been shown that this is not always true ([Tamura et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05399))."

    "##### Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion is responsible for the loss calculation. To calculate the loss we first need to choose which of the candidate bounding boxes to associate to the ground truth bounding box. As previously said, we only consider the bounding boxes obtained from the graph nodes that correspond to the entity that is the subject of the region description, sine this is the target entity to detect. Notice that here we make the assumption that the first entity of the scene graph is the subject of the region description. We deemed not necessary to apply a NLP tool to extract the subject of the sentence since we never observed a case in the dataset where the subject was not the first entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which of the candidate bounding boxes match to the target bounding box, we adopt the same approach used by DETR-like models. In particular, for each candidate bounding box, we compute the cost of matching it with the ground truth. The cost is computed as the weighted sum of three differents factors:\n",
    "1. the L1 distance between the coordinates of the candidate bounding box and the ground truth bounding box;\n",
    "2. the Generalized IoU between the candidate bounding box and the ground truth bounding box;\n",
    "3. the negative cosine similarity between the node embedding of the candidate bounding box and the text embedding of the region description.\n",
    "Notice that since there is only one ground truth bounding box, we do not need to apply the full Hungarian matching algorithm, but we can simple select the candidate that minimizes the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the matching is done, we can compute the loss between the matched bounding boxes. The loss is computed as the weighted sum of three different losses:\n",
    "1. the L1 loss between the coordinates of the matched bounding boxes;\n",
    "2. the Generalized IoU ([Rezatofighi et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09630)) loss between the matched bounding boxes;\n",
    "3. the InfoNCE loss ([Oord et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748)) where the positive sample is the embedding of the matched node and the negative samples are the embeddings of the other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two losses are the canonical losses used by DETR-like models to make the network learn to correctly predict the bounding box coordinates. Here, we remove the classification loss (usually computed using focal loss) since we do not need to predict the class of the selected node; its class is already known from the input scene graph. However, since at inference time we select among the candidate nodes the one with the highest similarity with the text embedding of the region description, we use a contrastive loss (here, InfoNCE) to force the network to pull together the embeddings of the matched node and the text embedding of the region description and to push away the embeddings of the other wrong nodes. Since it has been shown that InfoNCE performs better when the number of negative samples is high, as negative samples we do not use only the other subject nodes but all the nodes of all the graphs in the same batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, similarly to other DETR-like models, the loss is computed not only with respect to the output of the last decoder layer but also with respect to the output of the intermediate decoder layers. In particular, for each layer we recompute the matching and the corresponding loss. "

    "Unfortunately, given the computational cost of the model (it takes 2.5 hours for epoch on a gpu H100), we were able to perform only one training session (notice that the training session was stopped after 16 epochs because of overfitting, see later). Hereafter, we report some plots to summarize the results of the training session (to see all the logged statistics see the run on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/visgator/sgg/runs/z3ruios2)."

    "From the reported plots we can make two main observations:\n",
    "1. The performances of the model improves slowly. Indeed, both train and evaluation metrics improve approximately by 0.01 every epoch. This may be due to a too small learning rate that does not allow the model update its parameters fast enough. The second possibility is that the model already starts from a good initialization point (thanks to the position bias given by the detector) and has not enough capacity to significantly improve its performances. Note that the limited capacity of the model may not necessarily be due to the decoder, but it may depend also on the vision encoder. Indeed, the CLIP vision encoder was trained on image level tasks thus it is not trained to extract region level features that are needed to perform object detection. Thus, more experiments are needed to understand which factor is the most important. \n",
    "2. The model is clearly overfitting after epoch 8. Indeed, while all training metrics keep improving, all evaluation metrics starts to decrease. This can be seen also by looking at the training and evaluation losses. All the training losses keep decreasing, while most of the evaluation losses starts to increase or remain stable after epoch 8. In particular, the GIoU loss for all layers has a huge increase after epoch 13, while the InfoNCE increases much more slowly. The only loss that keeps decreasing is the L1 loss. Unfortunately, we were not able to perform more experiments to try to solve this problem. Possible techniques to solbe such problem could be to increase the weight decay, to add data augmentations, to increase the dropout (in our experiment we used a relatively low dropout of 0.1) or to adopt dropout strategies like DropHead ([Zhou et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13342)) or structured dropout ([Fan et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/1909.11556)), even though the number of layers should not be the cause of the overfitting since we only have 3 decoder layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the data augmentations, in the repository we have already implemented many augmentations using `torchvision` and `albumentations` (see `deepsight.data.transformations`). We decided not to use them to first verify whether the model was able to learn in the simplest setting. However, we believe that data augmentations could be very useful to improve the performances of the model, since are often used in object detection models. However, due to the functioning of the proposed model, many traditionally used augmentation cannot be used. For example, random cropping cannot be used simce it may lead to the removal of entities referred in the sentence. Similarly, geometric operations like random rotation, affine transformations or perspective transformations can be applied only on a small scale since they may alter the spatial position of an entity and thus compromise the spatial attributes contained in the input sentence. Lastly, also pixel transformation like hue or color jittering can not be applied too strongly since thay may cause complete alteration of the colours in the image and thus compromise the colour attributes contained in the input sentence (for example, if the sentence says \"the red car\", if the image is too much altered, the car may not be red anymore).",

    "#### Is OwlViT helping?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, all the metrics of the proposed model are higher than the ones obtained by using OwlViT. At the beginning, we said that we decided to use a detector to give the detector a bias about where each entity may be in the image. In this way, the decoder can not start the localization from scratch but it can simply refine the predictions made by the detector, making the training faster and the accuracy higher (since the detector is trained on much more data than our model). Here, we want to verify how much the detector helps the model by measuring how much the decoder refines the bounding boxes predicted by the detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, for each sample in the test set we compute the L1 distance between the refined bounding box and the bounding box initially predicted by the detector. Then, we measure the correlation between such distance and the accuracy of the model (here measured as IoU) across all the test samples. If there is a positive correlation between the two variables, it means that the decoder needs to refine the bounding boxes predicted by the detector a lot to obtain a good accuracy. On the other hand, if there is a negative correlation between the two variables, it means that the decoder is still refining the bounding boxes a lot but it is doing it in the wrong way, meaning that the model has not learned to refine the bounding boxes correctly. Finally, if there is no correlation between the two variables, no significant conclusion can be drawn.\n",

    "We report here three interesting ways in which the model could be improved in the future:\n",
    "1. The first way is to use a better vision encoder. As we have seen, the CLIP vision encoder is not trained to extract region level features that are needed to perform object detection. Thus, it would be interesting to use a vision encoder that is trained to extract region level features.\n",
    "2. Remove the detector and make the decoder perform the detection task from scratch. First of all, this would reduce the training and inference time since the model would be much smaller. Furthermore, this would require the model to be trained on larger dataset (like LVIS, Object365, etc.) and thus the modle would be able to learn better features. Particularly interesting would be training the model on Visual Genome since it already provides the scene graph for each region. This would allow to train the model on higher quality data and to supervise the model not only using the bounding box of the subject but the boundign boxes of all the entities referred in the region description. \n",
    "3. Train a new text encoder that would not only encode the text but it would also build the scene graph of the inout sentence (similarly to how [Attardi et al. 2022](https://github.com/Unipisa/diaparser) uses a transformer to obtain the dependency graph of the input sentence). This would allow not only to generate more accurate scene graphs but it would also lead the model to generate text encodings that contain high-level information about the context described in the sentence."
